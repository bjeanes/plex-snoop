# Plex snoop

Sets up a Plex Media Server MITMd by [`mitmproxy`](https://mitmproxy.org/) with the aim of learning more about how the
PMS talks to Plex.tv and other upstream services (metadata, avatars, analytics, etc).

This is in service of project I am building which needs to talk to the undocumented Plex.tv APIs. You are welcome to
use it too.
